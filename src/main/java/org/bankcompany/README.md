# Digital Bank Simulator (Java OOP Challenge)

This project is a solution for a Java programming challenge from the DIO Santander Bootcamp. It simulates a basic digital banking system using object-oriented principles.

## Features

    - Savings Account

- **Operations:**
    - Deposit funds
    - Withdraw funds (with balance and overdraft checks)
    - Transfer funds between accounts within the bank

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** The programming language used to implement the system.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are utilized to create a structured and extensible design.
